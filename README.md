# spike_node_postgresql

A learning environment to test node with a database

## Just a cool note

This project ran on a factory resetted Macbook Pro 13 M1 that only had installed VS Code, Git, Docker Desktop, and Docker CLI.
Node and PostgreSQL server were entirelly virtualized and running from the container with 0 dependencies on the local machine!

This a major refactor, it needs to be test, but most impotantly I need to drop the table assigments as it has a typo and we need to recreate it.
